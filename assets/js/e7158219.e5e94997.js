RMMV Approaches and Tools - an Overview","description":"This Section describes how RMMV approaches, and tools, including data sources are classified. Although one may immediately think of technology when considering RMMV, the success of RMMV approaches depends on involving the right people and planning the right courses of action. Projects using RMMV can be implemented without special technology, but only with good routines, good management, and the involvement of substitute actors.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"chapter-03-project-cycle":{"id":"chapter-03-project-cycle","title":"3. RMMV within the Financial Cooperation Project Cycle","description":"This Section offers concrete practical advice to all Financial Cooperation (FC) project stakeholders for manag- ing a FC project remotely. It describes the relevance of RMMV for each step along the FC project cycle and provides tangible recommendations on what needs to be considered during each step, as well as checklists, templates, and examples. KfW must adapt its own approaches and tool types to be able to conduct its crucial verification tasks (project appraisal; progress reviews, including verification of the use of funds; final reviews; and ex-post evaluation) despite limited access to project sites and target groups. It is important to note, how- ever, that the recommendations of this Guidebook do not replace or change any official KfW procedures during the FC project cycle, but rather provide assistance to KfW and its implementing partners in how to execute these procedures in a remote modality.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"chapter-04-project-experience":{"id":"chapter-04-project-experience","title":"4.

This trend has been further accelerated and broadened by the COVID-19 pandemic.
