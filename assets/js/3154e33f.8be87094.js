The likelihood of reaching a near-representative or at least socially inclusive share of the pop- ulation through mobile survey technology will increase along with rates of mobile phone penetration, house- hold mobile phone ownership, the functional and ICT literacy of women and other vulnerable or marginalized groups, ICT affordability, and ICT connectivity. At least, the following topics are to be considered."}),"\n",(0,i.jsxs)(t.p,{children:["\ufffd Access to electricity: In Sub-Saharan Africa, some 600 million people (almost two-thirds of the region's population) do not have regular electricity, while 15% have no electricity access at all. 12 However, this however only severely limits mobile phone network access for people with no electricity access at all.\r\n\ufffd Mobile phone ownership: In 2024, 5.61 billion people worldwide used a mobile phone (equaling 69.4% network access, of which an estimated half are smartphones). 13 However, Asian-Pacific and African coun- tries in particular lag behind. While the percentage of smartphone use is increasing (by the end of 2020, over 4 billion people were using mobile internet, representing 51% of the world's population) 14, poor and rural populations in particular only have access to simple mobile phones without broadband access or the advanced computing functions of a smartphone. Currently, cross-national data sets on mobile phone penetration, such as provided by the World Bank, are based on estimations of the number of cellular subscriptions. However, this may not accurately reflect penetration (i.e., the percentage of phone owners among the population), as one person may own multiple mobile phones. An increasing but still limited number of national statistical institutes of developing countries are providing more accurate information on mobile phone ownership.\r\n\ufffd Access to internet: Basic access to broadband internet is available in every capital and larger city around the world, but rural communities are often excluded. In January 2024, 5.35 billion people use the internet (66%). 15 Merely 45.5% of people in Africa have access to the internet today though 16, and current growth trends suggest we will be well into the second half of the 2020s before we see internet access levels across the continent pass the 50% mark. Broadband access rates are even worse, especially in remote and rural areas. In many countries, broadband internet is quite expensive. High prices may exclude poor people from usage, even when network access is available.\r\n\ufffd Network infrastructure: One common reason why people do not access the internet is poor mobile net- work infrastructure. For projects where mobile phones needed to transfer data, it is recommended to use a mobile operator with at least 3G net coverage, otherwise long waiting times may occur. 3G net coverage is given in most countries in the world, but the available net coverage differs regionally. 4G coverage had increased to 84% in lower-middle-income countries (LMIC) by the end of 2020.\r\n\ufffd Usage gap: Even though the coverage gap has narrowed in recent years (see above), there is still a huge gap in usage. In 2022, 38% or 3 billion people did not use mobile internet despite living in areas with mobile broadband coverage. 17\r\n\ufffd Gender gap: There is also a sobering gender gap online. In developing countries, the parity between male and female internet users can be startling. In Sub-Saharan Africa, the gender gap can range from 10-62%. 18 Women in low and middle-income countries are, on average, 17% less likely to own a mobile\r\nphone than men, and 19% less likely to use mobile internet. 19 The gender gap is significantly lower in urban than in rural areas, and for younger versus older women. In addition to mobile phone access, there is also a gender gap regarding phone use due to illiteracy, functional literacy or limitation to the local language (as opposed to the official language), which must be considered.\r\n\ufffd National ICT expertise: Moreover, the existence of progressive and pro-competitive regulatory ICT-policy frameworks and national ICT R&D funds are usually associated with higher levels of in-country ICT exper- tise. This, in turn, would be an enabling factor for realization of the technical infrastructure for the project. National ICT experts will likely be better qualified to develop software solutions that are suited to the speci- fic local context and to sustainably maintain the necessary hardware than external international consul- tants.

The more implementation responsibility the consultant takes on, the more expensive it gets.\r\n\ufffd Third-party monitoring consultants are relatively affordable (> Section 2.1.1, A4). Usually they also cost a small fraction (1 to 5%) of the total project volume, assuming that only a sample of outputs and/or outcomes is monitored. It must be considered however that frequently a TPM consultant is recruited in addition to an Implementation Consultant, which increases overhead cost.\r\n\ufffd Third-party monitoring through technical audit is even more affordable (> Section 2.1.1, A4): this approach, used for example in a KfW-financed project in Yemen, was estimated to cost less than 1% of the overall project sum.

Examples of this are socioeconomic databases (mostly open and free), satellite-based remote sensing (usually less than EUR 10 per image per sqm) and camera-based remote sensing (a 360-degree camera can cost between EUR 150 and EUR 1,000) and intelligent sensing (sensors cost can vary between EUR 1 and EUR 500 per unit).\r\n\ufffd Standard monitoring or data analysis and visualization tools can be significantly cheaper if existing (open) data sources are initially or from periodically combined with project-generated data through a data dash- board solution (e.g., Power BI, Tableau etc.).\r\n\ufffd Software development services and software licensing fees can be relatively expensive.
