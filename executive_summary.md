#Executive Summary

Remotely managed and monitored international development projects have been an expanding mode of practice in environments where security risks are high. This trend has been further accelerated and broadened by the COVID-19 pandemic. The ensuing travel restrictions and social distancing measures have caused a shift in thinking about how work can be accomplished remotely and may significantly expand the use of Remote Management, Monitoring, and Verification (RMMV) methods to allow interna- tional development cooperation practitioners to continue operating in areas with severely limited or no access.
In addition, RMMV approaches and tools may improve the quality of monitoring for pro- jects without access problems, but covering many locations (e.g. in decentralization, health or education sectors) or widespread areas, such as forestry, biodiversity or agri- cultural programs.
RMMV is a framework developed by KfW that responds to challenges that arise for stakeholders of KfW-financed development cooperation projects if they cannot travel to project sites and opens opportunities for digitally supported project implementation and management. It offers a methodology, institutional approaches, technical tools, data sources, and practical advice for ways to overcome difficulties when managing, monitoring, and verifying projects remotely (for the KfW definition of RMMV, > Section

An earlier internal version of this Guidebook had been developed in 2018 and was sub- stantially updated and expanded during the pandemic. During this overhaul, it became more and more obvious that this version might be not only useful for KfW but all its partners and the international development community globally. For this reason, the RMMV Guidebook is now being published as a basis for the further collective develop- ment of RMMV approaches and tools as a global public good.

The purpose of this Guidebook is to give an overview of KfW’s current RMMV approaches and how to apply them in donor-funded projects. After an introduction to RMMV and an overview of institutional approaches, technical tools, and data sources, the core of the Guidebook explains how to utilize RMMV within a typical KfW project cycle. The Guidebook assembles KfW’s experience and complements it with the experi- ence of other development partners in using RMMV approaches. It synthesizes the knowledge of relevant projects and builds on their best practices and lessons learned. After introducing the general concept of RMMV in > Section 1 Introduction to RMMV,
>	Section 2 RMMV Approaches and Tools explains the main types of institutional RMMV approaches, technical tools, and data sources, as well as the most important legal, regulatory and human rights aspects to be considered with regards to RMMV and IT- infrastructure aspects. These aspects need to be considered when using the updated and expanded RMMV Decision Matrix in > Section 2.5. This RMMV Decision Matrix serves as the basis for selecting and combining the appropriate institutional approaches, tool types, and data sources for the project. In > Section 3 RMMV within the FC Project Cycle, the Guidebook includes practical tools that can be chosen to assemble the appropriate mix of RMMV approaches at each stage of the FC project cycle—from project preparation to project end, including such topics as government negotiations, feasibility studies, tendering of consulting services, project progress, and final reviews. > Section 4 KfW RMMV Project Experience includes best–practice project examples. Additional resources, such as a glossary of RMMV terms, Fact Sheets on the RMMV tool types and data sources, the new KfW project location data collection guide- lines, and a list of relevant literature are included in the > Annexes.
The information gathered in this Guidebook has been collected from a review of KfW pro- ject documents, RMMV guidelines and studies, input from experienced KfW staff who are already applying RMMV approaches in their daily work, internal and external workshops, as well as input from KfW technical experts, legal, contract and procurement specialists, team leaders and sector economists since 2017. KfW’s experience is complemented by a body of literature on RMMV and interviews with partners, other donors, consultants, RMMV service providers, and other non-development actors that use RMMV approaches, for example in the private sector.

Although this Guidebook refers to KfW’s mode of operation, the RMMV principles, recommendations, approaches, methods, tools, and data sources can be transferred to the needs and business models of other international development stakeholders.

RMMV can be implemented within a project using the most appropriate combination of institutional approaches, technical tool types, and data sources:
•	Institutional RMMV approaches: Project stakeholders with continued access to the region—such as national/local staff, local consultants, and/or the target group itself— collect information, thus substituting and/or complementing KfW international staff and the Project Executing Agency (PEA) and/or consultant. For a full overview of insti- tutional approaches, > Section 2.1.1.
•	Technical tool types: Information and communication technology (ICT) that facilita- tes collecting, transmitting, aggregating, structuring, analyzing, verifying, visualizing, and interpreting information. For a full overview of technical tool types,
>	Section 2.2.1.

•	Data Sources: There is a wealth of internal and external, open and proprietary data sources already available that can be used for comparison with the data collected via institutional approaches and technical tools. This helps in verifying the information given in feasibility studies and progress reports. For a full overview of the uses of data sources, > Section 2.2.3.

In any given project, institutional approaches, technical tools, and data sources are com- bined and tailored to the respective project needs and environment.

How To Integrate RMMV Into the Financial Cooperation Project Cycle
Choosing an adequate RMMV approach for a project depends on a variety of parameters. KfW staff, together with the PEA, and/or the consultant need to decide:
•	What information and what level of data insight are required, and how often (the project partners staff may compare this with the general reporting requirements set out for the consultant to answer this question)?
•	Who needs to have remote access to the information and which stakeholders need to be involved to obtain the information?
•	What could be an adequate source of information (e.g., Open Data, national KfW experts, Third-Party Monitoring, satellite pictures, video proof, 360 images/films, local consultants conducting focus group discussions or environmental sensor data) or a suitable (technical) tool type to collect the required information?

KfW’s RMMV Guidebook provides advice on how to integrate RMMV approaches through- out the different steps of the project cycle. In each step, specific aspects need to be taken into consideration to ensure the effective and efficient integration of RMMV approaches.

Throughout the project cycle, RMMV activities need to be planned and agreed upon as early as possible, especially if they require significant investment, are exceptions from 
current regulations, or potentially entail data risks. For example, project preparation and appraisal can be informed through feasibility studies that are facilitated by consultants using RMMV approaches.

During implementation, RMMV requires increased effort from KfW and project implementa- tion staff since data and information collection is often more complex and requires the trian- gulation of different data sources. Also, RMMV approaches often come with additional requirements regarding standard project management procedures—more frequent communi- cation with the PEA and other stakeholders may be needed throughout the project cycle if the portfolio manager cannot visit the PEA in person. Training and involving the national KfW office staff in establishing and implementing RMMV approaches require additional time and resources. In some cases, deviations from standard management procedures may be neces- sary, such as replacing progress review missions to project sites with virtual progress reviews.

An appropriate institutional setup is crucial for successful RMMV, distinguishing between the following three roles: the controller of the data/tool, the monitoring agent/data collector, and the data verifier; > Section 2.1.2 Institutional Setup and Changing Stakeholder Roles in RMMV. To plan and implement projects correctly, a clear distinction is necessary between the two levels of monitoring: the first level is the Remote Monitoring conducted by the PEA/the project’s Implementation Consultant, which informs the regular project monitoring reports (i.e., usually the data owner and data collector) and the second level is the Remote Verification of the project monitoring information to be conducted by the KfW project staff responsible for the respective project (usually the data reader and data verifier); > Section 1.2 What is RMMV from a KfW Perspective?

To provide orientation on the usefulness of different institutional approaches, technical tools and data sources, information needs have been clustered into five general types that occur at different stages throughout the project cycle:
