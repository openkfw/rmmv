# 4. KfW RMMV Project Experience

## 4.1 Examples of Using RMMV for Project Preparation
### 4.1.1 Forecasting Floods Using Open Data for Project Preparation in Gaza

Project: Storm Water and Renewable Energy for WASH Facilities in Gaza (PN: 54338)

Open, freely accessible data was used for the site selection of a flood protection project in the Gaza Strip.

Background situation: In the densely populated Gaza Strip, devastating floods occur regularly. The drinking water situation is extremely tense, with only a very small part of the population having safe access to clean water. The coastal aquifer has been overexploited for years and is affected by salinization due to seawater intrusion, so that water suppliers increasingly have to shut down wells. The project, which is currently being prepared and is to be implemented by the responsible Water and Wastewater Association in Gaza, also aims to regenerate the groundwater, even though the first priority is protecting the population.

Project measures: Which areas in the Gaza Strip are threatened by flooding? To plan flood protection infrastructure and prioritize locations, publicly available data from various sectors was collected and analyzed. This eliminated the need for costly and time-consuming onsite inspection of the area, which in the Gaza Strip would only be possible with a high degree of coordination and stringent security measures. A digital model of the data with a grid resolution of 250 meters was created for the 360 square kilometer area of the Gaza Strip. This showed that there is special risk of flooding in the vicinity of Wadi Gaza. The model also visualizes lower-lying depressions that are at risk of flooding during heavy rainfall.

RMMV approach: The basic information and maps are based on Google Maps and maps from the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (> OCHA) as well as other data sources (institutional RMMV approach A6, see > Section 2.1.1). The terrain elevation model with 30-meter resolution was provided by > ESA (Copernicus Digital Elevation Model COPDEM GLO-30). The project received data on flood areas and statistics from the > Joint Research Center (JRC) of the European Commission. Regional precipitation statistics were provided by the > German Weather Service, > NASA and the > Center for Climatic Research at the University of Delaware. Since no public sources of terrestrial precipitation measurements were available, values from neighboring measuring stations and model-based

estimates from satellite data were used. General data on water consumption in the past from the > European Geosciences Union was available. The open data from the various sources was compiled using QGIS software.

Impact and success factors: Analyzing the data afforded better preparation for discussions with project partners and clients.
Locations, types and dimensions of the envisioned flood protection infrastructure could thus be determined in advance. If a preparatory visit is not required, the method is not only suitable for areas that are difficult to access but also for large areas and entire stretches of land in order to gain a preliminary understanding of the topographical and morphological site conditions. The visualization of watercourses without costly data acquisition rapidly yielded avisible, pictorial result. The main result in this example is the verification of statements about areas at risk for flooding, the existence of depressions without natural runoff, and the presence of settlements and economic activity in the investigated areas which need to be considered in selecting project sites.
4.1.2 Building a National Health Emergencies Monitoring and Management System in Nepal

## 4.2 Examples of Using RMMV for Project Implementation
### 4.2.1 Remote Project Progress Monitoring and Verification in the Lake Chad Region

Project: COVID-19 Emergency Aid-Support for the National Health Sector Program (OSCAR)

The Nepalese health authorities are working with an open-source common digital decision support system for more efficient containment of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Background situation: In humanitarian crises, knowledge on the scope of an emergency and of the available resources is often lacking early on, entailing inefficient allocation in the required responses to those in need. The COVID-19 pandemic hit Nepal particularly hard due to its wide-spread poverty and limited capacities in the health sector.

Project measures: To address this challenge, OSCAR, as an innovative platform and common digital decision support system for humanitarian operations, was employed for the analysis of large datasets for emergency preparedness and response. The platform was used to compile baseline and situational data from various sources to form a common operational picture and enable the respective analyses. This free, open-source platform thus enables the prioritization of scarce human and financial resources. At the same time, OSCAR creates a suitable data basis for decision-making on immediate and longer-term measures.

RMMV approach: OSCAR combines baseline and situational data from health management information systems, household surveys, crowdsourcing, remote sensing via satellites and other geospatial tool types from the national government, its bilateral partners, the UN and nongovernmental organizations. OSCAR is currently being deployed in Nepal to help the country better manage the pandemic. Propelled by swift cooperation between Nepal's Ministry of Health and Population, the World Health Organization Country Office and KfW, OSCAR is at an advanced stage of conceptual and data systemic development: the platform provides an up-to-date overview on daily and cumulative case numbers, disease severity, trends and available versus occupied healthcare capacity.

Impact and success factors: In Nepal, OSCAR will contribute to the implementation of Nepal's health strategy, to improving the health situation of the Nepalese population and to containing the COVID-19 pandemic through a more responsible and equitable health system.

Planned as a global public good, OSCAR is fully owned by partner countries while benefitting from the open-source community.
Over the long-term, OSCAR will support improved routine planning processes in health systems and support countries in confronting future pandemics. The application of OSCAR will benefit partnering countries in multiple ways, regarding the: 1) monitoring of health trends, 2) rapid detection of outbreaks and health crises, 3) combining of capacity and epidemiological information

Map showing numbers of healthcare facilities in Nepal to determine risks, and 4) gauging of current and future health service demand. The platform is customized to a country's context and needs, is open-source, and can easily be scaled to other countries and sectors. With its Open-Data policy, the OSCAR platform welcomes development partners and developers with global, regional or local reach to combine their efforts and enlarge this open-source tool and community of practice that improves decision-making in health emergencies. Furthermore, an OSCAR opensource community will be established to contribute to the success of the platform by continuously improving code and developing further use cases tailored to emerging needs.

Project: Stabilization and Reconciliation in the Lake Chad Region Project  (StaR, PN: 39647):

In view of the precarious security situation around Lake Chad, the implementing nongovernmental organization (NGO), the Catholic Relief Service (CRS), set up a management information system (MIS) for the StaR project.

Background situation: On behalf of the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), KfW has been supporting a project to stabilize the
political situation in the region since 2019 in the four neighboring countries of Cameroon, Chad, Niger, and Nigeria. This includes the development of social infrastructure and incomegenerating measures and support for agriculture and good governance.

Project measures: The project, the current phase of which is set to run until 2024, includes almost 150 individual projects in the four countries, from solar power systems to new classrooms and water tapping points. A total of more than 170,000 people will benefit from it.

RMMV approach: In view of the tense security situation in the countries and the associated travel restrictions, CRS, the NGO serving as the Project Executing Agency (PEA) (> Section 2.1.1 RMMV Institutional Approach A2-PEA-Led Monitoring) started setting up an MIS early on. During the pandemic, KfW was able to use the MIS during project progress reviews for individual infrastructure projects in Niger and Nigeria. An interactive project map provided a good overview and contained comprehensive information in the form of photos, videos and documents. Local PEA employees demonstrated the progress of construction sites by means of onsite live video recordings. This virtual tour not only showed the current status but also enabled discussions with stakeholders. The MIS (> Fact Sheet R/MIS) is made up of a variety of software packages. Data, including photos (> Fact Sheet Cameras), are collected and archived via tablet and smartphone with open-source and cloud-based CommCare software (> Fact Sheet Mobile Data Collection), and all project communication for administration, decision-making and monitoring carried out via MS Teams (> Fact Sheet Collaboration Tools). The geolocation of the project locations is done using ArcGIS-geoinformation system software (> Fact Sheet Geospatial Tools/GIS) and the transfer to dashboards and report formats is done using business intelligence software. The system is freely accessible and virtual site visits are possible at any time at > https://arcg.is/1uPL19

Impact and success factors: The COVID-19 pandemic and the increasingly fragile security situation in the region served as catalyst for the development of MIS tools and remote communication. However, there is no personal contact with the population and civil society stakeholders in this format, making it difficult to classify the project's impacts. Nevertheless, many of the formats tested will be retained in the long term.


4.2.2 Remote Monitoring of Small-Scale Irrigation Systems in Mali
Project: Small-Scale Irrigation in the Inner Delta  (IPRODI, PN:39309)

To monitor a small-scale irrigation project in the north of Mali, the Project Executing Agency (PEA), consultant and KfW are using a geographical information system (GIS) for mobile data collection, including photographic and satellite image analysis, as there are several dozen individual projects spread across the region and due to the security situation, no personal onsite visits are possible.
A local consultant was commissioned for the final inspection following third-party verification.

Background situation: Northern Mali suffers from drought and desertification. Since 1960, the annual average temperature in Mali has increased by 0.7 degrees. Mali is in the Sahel region, one of the world's regions most affected by climate change.
The country is also one of the poorest in the world. Farmers in northern Mali depend on the Niger River for irrigation of their fields, the resources of which must be used sustainably.

### 4.2.3 Construction Site Supervision Using an MIS in Pakistan

Project: Regional Infrastructure Fund KP II  (RIF-II, PN: 30272, 42975)

KfW remotely verifies the progress of several public infrastructure construction sites spread over a province in northern Pakistan using a management information system (MIS).

Background situation: The province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in northern Pakistan is one of the poorest in the country. Unemployment is higher than average and economic growth is low. According to the World Bank's definition, approximately 46% of the population lives in poverty. Most people generate income from agriculture and small businesses. The region is mountainous, and the road network is minimal. In winter, many places are completely cut off from the outside world. Because of inadequate road access, the transport of goods is expensive. Both internally displaced persons and refugees from Afghanistan have sought protection in the province. As a result, the existing-already inadequate-infrastructure is extremely overloaded. A flood disaster


Project measures: KfW has been involved in the IPRODI project on behalf of the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) since 1994. What started out as an emergency aid program has grown into a project for improved infrastructure for small-scale irrigation. This involves the management of village irrigation, the construction of wells, the use of pumps and measures to protect the soil. Small warehouses are being built, too. The project includes more than 1,100 individual measures dispersed across northern Mali. Project visits are therefore time-consuming. In addition, the security situation is becoming increasingly precarious. KfW relies on Remote Verification to keep apprised of the project's progress.

RMMV approach: As early as 2004, GPS data on the irrigated areas and the motorized pumps were entered into a geographical information system GIS, also known as a digital map. What was initially done by mobile phone and manual entry was soon replaced by image recording with automatically embedded GPS data. This made it possible to obtain information remotely about the irrigated areas and the condition of the infrastructure. Since 2014, satellite images have been evaluated and stored in the GIS to monitor the project's status. In addition to the Ministry of Rural Development, which serves as the PEA for the project, a Financial Cooperation (FC) consultant has access to the project data (RMMV Institutional Approach A2-PEA-Led Monitoring
> Section 2.1.1).

Due to the pandemic and the precarious security situation, KfW also commissioned a local consultant to conduct the onsite final inspection in 2020 (RMMV Institutional Approach A4-ThirdParty Verification > Section 2.1). In 2021, a KfW team conducted onsite inspections of several accessible project locations. The progress of the others was determined using Remote Verification.


Impact and success factors: The preparation of systematic Remote Monitoring by the PEA using satellite images requires a longer lead time, as an RMMV unit had to be set up and trained by the PEA with the support of the FC consultant. This type of approach is therefore more appropriate for long-term or multi-phase projects. Current and high-resolution satellite images are not available for every location around the world, so it is important to check whether all project locations are covered.
This was the case in Mali. The complex project could be efficiently evaluated with the GIS and the analysis of satellite images.

in 2010 also destroyed roads and bridges.

Project measures: The goal is to improve government services in the provinces and districts and to strengthen the government's capacity to build infrastructure. On behalf of the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), KfW is therefore financing up to 27 smallto medium-sized construction projects, from a suspension bridge to roads, drinking water supply systems and rainwater drainage. The local population was involved in selecting the construction projects to be implemented.

Strengthening the government's capacity should also increase acceptance by the population. The authorities need to develop the ability to plan, tender and implement public construction projects independently.

RMMV approach: An MIS was set up by the Implementation Consultant to track construction progress and the use of funds online (RMMV Institutional Approaches A1-National KfW Experts with Increased Responsibility in Remote Verification and A3-Consultant-Led Monitoring > Section 2.1). The MIS dashboard shows the geographical location of the construction sites. KfW has read access and can track the status of construction projects in real time in the MIS. An image gallery shows current photos taken by the Implementation Consultant as part of the construction supervision process (tool type: cameras). This includes 360-degree images that can be viewed using 3D headsets. Links to videos of construction site inspections are also provided. The MIS also contains the monthly reports to provide all relevant information in one place.

Impact and success factors: With just a few clicks, the KfW PM can access the project reports and the most recent images

View of MIS Project Dashboard

and videos. The amount of information available is significantly greater than with conventional reporting. The progress of the construction projects can be verified at any time. Expansion of the infrastructure will improve the population's living conditions in the selected districts and boost the government's capacities.


### 4.2.4 Using a 360?-Camera to Remotely Verify Construction Quality in Inaccessible Areas of a Hospital in Tanzania
### 4.2.5 Remotely Managing Maternal and Child Health in Yemen Using a Mobile Voucher App

Project: Co-financing of the CCBRT Maternity and  Newborn Hospital (PN: 30222)

KfW is testing the transmission of images through a 360-degree camera from a hospital in Tanzania that it financed on behalf of the BMZ, to asses performance quality for itself in inaccessible areas.

Background situation: The maternal mortality rate in the urban area of Dar es Salaam is significantly higher than in rural areas due to high immigration rates and overloaded health infrastructure. The construction of a new Maternity and Newborn Hospital by the local non-governmental 112 CCBRT (Comprehensive Community Based Rehabilitation in Tanzania) in Dar es Salaam is intended to contribute to reducing persistently high maternal and newborn mortality rates and preventing disabilities in Tanzania.

Project measures: Together with other international donors, KfW is co-financing the construction of the above-mentioned maternity hospital on behalf of the BMZ. As a reference hospital for the Eastern Zone of Dar es Salaam, the facility, with an annual patient admission capacity of 15,000 patients and 12,000 deliveries/year, is intended as a "Super Specialized Hospital" to complement the capacities and competencies of hospitals in the region and improve training and further education for midwives, nurses and gynecologists, particularly on managing highrisk pregnancies and births and neonatology.

The hospital has six operating theatres that have been equipped with state-of-the-art technology.

RMMV approach: Due to the pandemic, it was not possible to monitor the progress of work on-site in the spring of 2020.
Together with the project-executing agency, the NGO "Comprehensive Community Based Rehabilitation in Tanzania" (CCBRT), which operates the hospital (> institutional approach A2 PEA-led monitoring), and the Implementation Consultant, KfW therefore carried out one of the first virtual progress inspections and funded 112 audits (Remote Verification) in East Africa in May 2020. Two virtual site visits took place during the period of pandemic-related suspension of progress reviews. After completion of the work and initial commissioning of the hospital, due to ongoing surgeries it was not possible to inspect the completed operating theatres without further action during the first physical progress review. KfW thus used a 360-degree camera the size of a mobile phone within a pilot project. The camera allowed visual recording of the entire room in high quality within just a few minutes, and with little personnel and material input. The data were transmitted securely via mobile phone. The images were then analyzed on the large screens of the RMMV rooms at KfW. Future use of VR goggles will allow virtual inspection of the premises. The technical possibilities are given, and the first necessary data have been secured using the 360-degree camera.

Impact and success factors: The camera walk-through can be used as a complement to physical travel, e.g. if travel is temporarily not possible or if certain questions have to be clarified at very short notice. It can also be used if certain areas of the project are not accessible (turbines, laboratories, operating theatres, etc.). In the present application, KfW was able to visually inspect the scope of the equipment in the operating theatres and the quality of workmanship, such as the suspended ceilings, the functionality of the lighting, etc. The medical experts are currently inspecting the equipment in the operating theatres. Currently, medical experts from KfW are assessing the recordings in order to evaluate future application possibilities from a medical-technical perspective.

Project: Maternal and Child Health Voucher Program Phase II (PN: 27451)

On behalf of the German Federal Government, KfW is supporting the Yemeni Yamaan Foundation in organizing a voucher system using a mobile app that gives mothers and their children better access to the healthcare system. This app is also used for Remote Monitoring.

Background situation: In Yemen, one of the poorest countries in the world, maternal mortality is very high. In this war-torn country, the Yamaan Foundation is committed to improving medical care for women. The foundation was established in 2009 with the support of KfW on behalf of the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ).

Project measures: Foundation employees distribute mobile phones to mothers supported by the project via vouchers in the form of pre-installed QR codes.

Women receive the vouchers on their mobile phones or as a printout for a nominal fee (or free of charge if required), which enable services such as supervised births, family planning and contraception, and transport to a health center. The recipient also receives a call from a center, which the foundation does to check whether the mother knows where her nearest health center is located. Every woman is notified of the free hotline, which she can contact if necessary. All vouchers are managed online.

RMMV approach: As the Project Executing Agency (PEA) (RMMV Institutional Approaches A2-PEA-Led Monitoring and A5-Target Group Involvement > Section 2.1.1), the Yamaan Foundation has developed an online solution for the distribution, redemption and settlement of vouchers. The system consists of a mobile app (> Fact Sheet MDC), a desktop app and a cloud-based application for the dashboard (> Fact Sheet R/MIS). The vouchers can be tracked online from their creation to their use (Remote Monitoring and Verification). The clinic to which the woman is sent scans the QR code, looks after her and later bills her benefits online with the health insurance provider. The vouchers are settled monthly so that the healthcare centers receive regular income. Trends in usage can also be monitored in this way. The foundation can track the number of vouchers distributed per employee. It can also track whether, as intended, the poorest target groups are reached, such as women with disabilities, marginalized families or internally displaced persons. The data also shows the number of vouchers billed by each healthcare center. The foundation can then see whether the project is achieving its objectives at a glance.

Impact and success factors: The war in Yemen, which has lasted for years now, makes it difficult to provide personal care


Overview of the main features of the Voucher Remote Monitoring System

for families in need. The voucher solution seems particularly practical in these circumstances. It eliminates corruption because every step is traceable online, from voucher distribution to redemption and billing. In turn, the foundation's vouchers provide a reliable source of income for healthcare facilities, midwives and doctors.

Recipient mothers can report complaints via a hotline if a healthcare facility does not perform the agreed service.

About 200,000 vouchers have been distributed since 2017, 80% of which have been redeemed. More than 30,000 babies have been born in good care thanks to the vouchers. For the women involved, supervised birth and family planning advice mean better health care for themselves and their children.


### 4.2.6 Setting up a Monitoring Information System for a Health Project in the Central African Republic
### 4.2.7 Remote Monitoring of Protected Areas Using Drones in Mongolia

Project: Reconstruction of the Health System  (RSS, PN: 34710, 35728)

Project monitoring is to be supported by the establishment of a Monitoring Information System (MIS) that is oriented towards the actual information needs and capacities of the project stakeholders and around technical feasibility considerations in the Central African Republic.

Background situation: After Niger, the Central African Republic is the poorest country in the world, marked by unending waves of violence and displacement in its interior since 2013. After a long suspension of cooperation, initial FC projects in the country were launched in 2014. Due to weak and in some cases non-existent government structures, cooperation is based primarily on the UN, EU and INGOs. FC projects in the Central African Republic focus mainly on covering basic needs, such as health, education, and food security. Due to the armed conflicts in Ukraine in 2022 and the Central African Republic's political proximity to Russia, international support for the country is currently declining and the prospects for long-term cooperation are unclear. The project, "Reconstruction of the Health System," with the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) as PEA is currently the only project within the Central African Republic financed from bilateral cooperation.

In the project, it quickly became clear that the humanitarian organization IFRC could demonstrate very good operational capabilities in an extremely fragile environment, but that monitoring a complex, development-oriented health project was a new challenge for the PEA. Combined with very limited opportunities for on-site missions and meeting between KfW and partners in the Central African Republic, a comprehensive RMMV approach was developed for a new phase of the project starting in 2022.

Project measures: The objective of the project is to increase the utilization of qualitatively improved health services by the target group (mainly women and children) in the project area (2 prefectures surrounding the capital, Bangui). Output 1 of the project aims to rehabilitate and equip 35 health stations in rural areas. Output 2 of the project serves to strengthen health personnel capacities in the country by rehabilitating and equipping two training institutes in Bangui on the one hand, and by providing scholarships for health training on the other, as well as direct financing of health personnel in the health stations of output 1.

RMMV approach: Monitoring by the PEA (> Section 2.1.1, Institutional Approach A2) is to be supported by the establishment of a Monitoring Information System (> MIS) that is oriented towards the actual information needs and capacities of the project stakeholders and around technical feasibility considerations in the Central African Republic. On the one hand, the platform is intended to make the partner's previous monitoring measures (especially time-consuming and expensive site visits) more efficient and substitute for these, and on the other hand to provide KfW and other stakeholders regular and reliable updates on the project's key performance indicators. The management of important decisions is increasingly carried out jointly between IFRC and KfW within the framework of virtual meetings, although intensive discussions with the partners on site at least every six months remain indispensable as a basis for building trust. Due to the critical security situation, KfW verifies the results of the project through the involvement of a local consultant (> Section 2.1.1, Institutional Approach A4 - Third Party Verification). Virtual site visits > Section 3.3 Remote Verification of Project Progress by KfW with project stakeholders organized by the local consultant are a new standard in FC.
Challenges with regard to accessing project sites is one of the major reasons why efficient Monitoring Systems for projects in the Central African Republic are necessary.
Impact and success factors: Transparency in communication about why RMMV is important, so as not to create the impression of deliberate mistrust of partners. First understand the information needs and capacities of all stakeholders, then talk about technical solutions (Human-Centered Design). Good monitoring costs money and must be budgeted for accordingly.

Project: Biodiversity and Adaptation to Climate Change  (PN: 29187)

Drones and GPS devices are used to monitor conservation areas in Mongolia efficiently.

Background situation: Mongolia plans to protect almost 30% of the country's area, amounting to 465,000 square kilometers. The country has a wide variety of ecosystems and is considered a real biodiversity hotspot. It is also a refuge for numerous endangered animal and plant species in Central and East Asia, further heightening the importance of the protected areas.
However, the administrative bodies of the protected areas have limited budgets, which usually cover little more than personnel costs. At the same time, the existing conservation areas are threatened by overgrazing, illegal logging and climate change. This in turn threatens the livelihoods of the rural population.

Project measures: On behalf of the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), KfW has been supporting the Mongolian Ministry of Environment since 2014 in preserving biodiversity in select ecologically significant protected areas and safeguarding the livelihoods of people in the region.
Management plans for the protected areas are being developed. Investments are also being made in vehicles, IT and research equipment, buildings for the protected area administrations and ranger uniforms.

RMMV approach: KfW has financed 71 drones for 33 natural protected areas as well as for three departments of the Ministry of Environment and the Environmental Tourism Office of the City of Ulaanbaatar. Each protected area administration received two drones. These help the rangers who work there monitor the movements of animals, analyze the animal population and detect forest fires early on occurring in the vast and often impassable terrain of the conservation areas. The drones (> Fact Sheets Drones/UAV) were acquired in 2019 based on a needs analysis for the participating Mongolian protected area administrations (RMMV Institutional Approach A2-Project Executing Agency-Led Monitoring , see > Section 2.1.1, A2). The employees of the organizations entrusted with monitoring of the protected areas have been trained in their use. These employees are also responsible for maintaining the drones. For cost reasons, simple models were chosen. The use of land by pasture cattle, for example, can be monitored as well. A new application has been developed based on field usage: once cattle have penetrated the core zones of the protected areas, they can be driven back to their pastures using drones.

Impact and success factors: So far, drones have proven useful for monitoring terrain that is too expansive to keep track of in other ways, and in areas where particularly sensitive species live. This even allows detecting forest fires at an early stage. Drones help efficiently monitor conservation areas, being especially beneficial because the administrative authorities often have a limited available workforce. Grazing cattle can be moved out of core zones, yielding an additional benefit. The drones' short flight time was identified as a drawback. The use of a second backup set of batteries can compensate for this to a certain extent.

### 4.2.8 Monitoring Forest Area Changes in Ecuador Using the REDD Monitoring System



Project: REDD Early Mover (REM, PN: 29763)

On behalf of the German Federal Government, KfW is supporting the protection of old-growth forests in Ecuador, with evidence of the change in the rate of deforestation being provided by a satellite-based REDD monitoring system.

Background situation: The REDD (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) Early Movers (REM) program is an initiative that rewards pioneers in forest conservation and the fight against climate change. The program supports REDD+ bridge financing and includes recognition of payment for results based on reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions caused by deforestation. In 2014, the Governments of Ecuador, Germany and Norway agreed on a Financial Cooperation project based on payments for REDD+ results to acknowledge Ecuador's efforts in reducing deforestation. Ecuador is one of three countries in which the REM program is being implemented. The South American country is one of the mega-biodiverse countries. Forty percent of the 11 million hectares of untouched primary forest are designated as protected areas.

Deforestation in Ecuador has progressed especially in the nineties, with agriculture, in particular, being seen as a driver. However, deforestation rates have declined since 2008. Government controls became more effective, and a rural exodus helped to reduce deforestation.

Project measures: To obtain funding from the REM Program, Ecuador must effectively demonstrate that annual deforestation is decreasing compared to a historic average. In a first step, historical deforestation maps were created showing how forest areas have decreased in the past. These change maps and emissions factors derived from the national forest inventory, estimating the carbon sequestered in the countries different forest ecosystems, form the foundation for the baseline, the forest reference emission level (FREL). Future emission reductions can be measured against this FREL, which is essential for building a results-based, REDD+ compliant payment system.

The rewards from the REM program are used to promote forest protection in the communities living in and deriving their living from the forest, to finance Ecuador's forest protection policies, to secure land ownership and to measure the decline in emissions.

RMMV approach: The REDD Monitoring System in Ecuador consists of a national forest monitoring system (NFMS) managed by the Ministry of Environment (RMMV Institutional Approach A2-Project Executing Agency-Led Monitoring, > Section 2.1.1, A2) based on an MIS (> Fact Sheet R/MIS) with satellite images (> Fact Sheet Earth Observation via Satellites) of all Ecuador forest areas, on the basis of which national GHG inventories are compiled. The NFMS produces a monitoring report, Based on a 5 km grid, a systematic sample was distributed throughout Ecuador. For the analysis, satellite images from the Landsat sensor were used as the main input and Sentinel 2 and Planet tiles as secondary inputs. In each sample, nine plots of one hectare each were analyzed to determine the changes in the forest cover. On this basis, the deforestation of Ecuador is calculated.


estimating emissions from deforestation for a certain period. Comparing these emissions against the FREL, the system estimates the emission reduction from reduced deforestation in a given year. These monitoring reports are then attested via independent third-party verification (RMMV Institutional Approach A4-Third-Party Monitoring > Section 2.1.1, A4) as a prerequisite for the remuneration of avoided emissions from deforestation. The independent consultant verifies the methodological accuracy (conceptual design and implementation of the methodology), including random sampling checks and safety margins (to take inaccuracies into account). The independent consultant also verifies whether the reported Emission Reductions (ERs) and the Reference Level have been reported via a transparent and coherent step-by-step process that enables reconstruction and meets the REM program requirements. In addition, civil society organizations are involved in decisions regarding use of funds (benefitsharing based on investment plans) (RMMV Institutional Approach A5-Involving a Defined Target Group, > Section 2.1.1, A5). REDD also requires the provision and publication of regular reporting on REDD Safeguards and emissions reports to the REDD Registry at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to assure that ERs measured for a given year were achieved in accordance with the Cancun Safeguards.

Impact and success factors: Forest conservation contributes to climate protection and biodiversity. The monitoring system enables Ecuador to demonstrate how it is contributing to reducing emissions in the land use sector, how deforestation rates are developing and where illegal clearing is taking place. The satellite image-based system is an indisputably effective means for substantiating changes in forested area. The remuneration from REM also benefits the indigenous population groups living in the forest.

### 4.2.9 Sustainable Forest Management Using RMMV in the Congo Basin
### 4.2.10 Establishing an Energy Monitoring System for Public Buildings in Montenegro

Project: Promotion of Certified Forest Management  (PPECF) II (PN: 39042)

The Program in the Congo Basin (PPECF) of the Central African Forestry Commission (COMIFAC), financed by KfW on behalf of the German government, uses drones, a Geographic Information System (GIS) and eLearning, as well as data to promote certified logging.

Background situation: The program to promote certified logging in the Congo Basin, financed by KfW on behalf of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), supports the Central African Forestry Commission (COMIFAC) in the certification process for sustainable logging.
Today, more than five million hectares of forest are already certified in the Congo Basin, with another 5 million hectares planned within the next two years. But the increase in certified areas faces obstacles, such as insufficient institutional support, a poorly organized civil society, a lack of scientific data and high costs for the social component of certification, such as the construction of health facilities, schools and roads.

Project measures: KfW supports forestry companies in forest certification and accompanies them through the initial audit for legality and sustainability certification so that they are recognized in accordance with the EU Timber Regulation. The project is aimed at forestry companies in Cameroon, Congo, Gabon, the Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

In particular, the project helps address social aspects of certification, such as worker living conditions and safety, local resident rights and biodiversity protection. Another goal is better monitoring of wildlife protection and the implementation of sustainable use models that cover the entire value chain, all the way to the consumer.

RMMV approach: Over the past ten years, the project's technical approach has evolved considerably. Whereas in the beginning, applications were made for individual corrective measures, today the program invests in technical solutions, such as software, interactive guides and specific platforms for fauna monitoring. These serve to maintain or improve the level of certification achieved. The project is aimed at establishing automated processes that facilitate management of the companies' activities.

These include, for example, mapping of forest areas in the GIS > Fact Sheet Geospatial Tools and the use of drone imagery for forest certification of tropical ecosystems > Fact Sheet Drones/ UAV. The GIS is used by forest managers to plan a trail network, for which electronic georeferencing is also employed. Logs are tagged with RFID chips to monitor action plans and logging > Fact Sheet Sensors/SmartMeters. The wildlife population in the forest areas is analyzed by cameras > Fact Sheet Cameras and audio monitoring. Distance learning via eLearning was conducted on the topic of "safe logging," for example > Fact Sheet eLearning Tools. In this way, more economically, socially and ecologically efficient operating procedures are being introduced step by step.

Project staff being trained on using geospatial tools

Impact and success factors: The certified area has risen to 5.5 million hectares for sustainable management, with another 5.5 million certified under a different label. So far, more than 30% of the participating companies have already implemented a social action plan that is accepted by the local population. Half of the companies have already introduced a wildlife management plan.

Project: Greening Public Infrastructure Program  (PN: 42455)

The project is designed to improve the energy efficiency and life span of public buildings through retrofitting and implementing of an energy monitoring system (EMS) drawing on a centralized database to remotely collect, analyze and manage energy and water consumption data from smart meters and the respective utilities.

Background situation: Many of Montenegro's public buildings are in poor structural condition. Heating systems do not work well, windows and doors are not tight, roofs leak and walls, ceilings and basement are not insulated. As a result, energy is lost unnecessarily. Improved energy efficiency is one of the most important goals of Montenegro's energy policy.

Project measures: While in the first two phases of the program financed by KfW loans and Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) grants were focused on improving energy efficiency through the rehabilitation and retrofitting of buildings with improved insulation, heating, photovoltaic systems, sanitary facilities, and so on, the third phase is about setting an example for even higher energy efficiency standards by upgrading some of the buildings to Near Zero Energy (NZE). In addition, the second and third phases of the Energy Efficiency Program include introduction of an Energy Monitoring System (EMS) for collecting data on energy and water consumption for the whole public sector. Energy managers will be able to make strategic decisions on energy consumption optimization by benchmarking energy consumption against the calculated energy demand for each facility, observing pre-defined user profiles. Montenegro is receiving an Energy Performance Calculation (EPC) software, which will enable the issuance of energy passports for buildings and the conducting of energy audits. Once audits are certified by the energy auditors, owners of apartments, houses and business premises will receive a document as proof of how energy efficient the property is. In the near future, selling or renting premises will no longer be possible without an energy passport.

RMMV approach: Real-time smart metering in 250 buildings and the transfer of consumption data from electricity and water utilities will enable hour-by-hour Remote Monitoring of consumption of electricity, water, CO2 levels in classrooms, temperature and heating fuel consumption > Fact Sheet Sensors/SmartMeters. For example, when a building consumes a particularly large amount of electricity, the peak loads can be observed on an hourly basis. This kind of consumption data was not available before. The EMS and availability of consumption data nearly in real time allow users to pay closer attention to their electricity, water and fuel consumption and make rapid adjustments accordingly > Fact Sheet R/MIS. This leads to a more conscious use of energy and resources. The EMS users are the energy managers of the up to 2,500 public buildings to be connected, as well as Real time-view of room temperature various ministries using it for planning and strategy purposes (institutional RMMV approach A2 - PEA is in the lead, see > Section 2.1.1, A2).

Impact and success factors: The annual consumption of energy measured after the rehabilitation measures undertaken in the first two phases of the program was reduced by 35%, and by as much as 63% versus the calculated energy demand baseline before the energy efficiency measures. Lower energy expenditures mean lower operating cost, noticeably relieving public budgets. The energy savings have contributed to a 69% annual reduction of CO2 emissions in the rehabilitated facilities.

Impact area: Energy efficiency

RMMV approach: A QGIS-Map of Vietnam divided into the different regions (regions with KfW projects are shaded), with color highlighting of the regions where there has been an increase in nighttime light intensity > Fact Sheet Geospatial Tools

Data sources: KfW project data, GADM, DMSP-OLS Nightlight Intensity > Fact Sheet Data Sources

Findings: A comparison of the Financial Cooperation (FC) project regions at the time of the 2009 project appraisal versus the year of the 2016 final inspection shows that, as measured by nighttime light intensity, there was an increase in economic activity in the FC project regions. The link between increased light intensity and increased economic activity is made by Min and Gaba (2014) in a study that confirmed this hypothesis using satellite data and household surveys. However, there are also increases in light intensity in other regions and no increases in regions with FC-financed projects. The data evaluated do not yet allow a conclusive positive assessment of the KfW-financed rehabilitation of the networks with regard to economic activity.

Lessons learned: The visualization allows us to draw a balance between needs and actual food distribution and conclude to what extent the choice of project sites met acute food needs in Yemen. The graph shows the needs gap in food distribution. The distribution of food was only partially carried out in the areas that are classified as particularly food insecure according to the IPC classification, so acute needs were not always addressed.
The graph was referenced to assess the OECD DAC evaluation criterion relevance.

Conclusion	5
Remote Management, Monitoring, and Verification (RMMV) of projects in international development cooperation have become an integral part of project management-in fragile contexts and beyond.
KfW's RMMV approach to remote project management holds tremendous promise for helping project teams and entire organizations continue their work in the face of circumstances that make it difficult to visit project sites in person - such as dangers to personnel due to working in fragile and conflict-affected environments, travel to remote areas being too difficult or costly, or circumstances of worldwide impact that render travel impossible, like the COVID-19 pandemic or other emergencies.


Since the first internal study and toolkit on RMMV in 2018, KfW has made impressive progress in developing RMMV by establishing basic communication channels in conflict zones, through setting up simple Management Information Systems for managing multi-site emergency programs more effectively, up to using sensor networks and Building Information Modeling for complex infrastructure projects or financing forest protection based on the results provided by satellite monitoring systems. The use of
Third-Party Monitoring has become more frequent and the role of KfW's national experts in its country offices is being continuously strengthened. The pandemic has further accelerated the capacity development of KfW and its partners and stakeholders in RMMV. The project experience presented in section 4 is illustrating this development as well as the diversity of approaches, tools and data sources being used across all sectors.

Also, the use of RMMV has moved beyond fragile contexts and its tools and data sources are becoming crucial parts of KfW's Digital-by-Default strategy, particularly in projects covering large areas or multiple locations.
The information in the Guidebook was collected from a review of KfW project documents and studies as well as input from experienced KfW staff who use RMMV approaches in their daily work and from KfW technical, legal, contract and procurement experts, team leaders and sector economists.

KfW's experience is complemented by inputs from consultancies on various RMMV aspects as well as interviews with partner governments and PEA staff, target groups representatives as well as other donors, UN, consultants, NGOs, RMMV service providers and other non-development actors that use RMMV approaches, such as private-sector organizations, and a body of literature and resources on RMMV. Although this Guidebook refers to KfW's institutional setup and procedures, the principles in play are of course transferable to the business models of other development stakeholders.

KfW hopes that you find the information in this Guidebook useful as you carry out your own RMMV activities. This is a living document that we will be updating regularly, thus we welcome your feedback as you use the Guidebook so that we can continue to improve it and add information on new approaches, technical tool types and data sources as it becomes available.

In order to institutionalize the continuous improvements of the Guidebook and live the spirit of the Principle for Digital Development "Be Collaborative," KfW is promoting the establishment of an international Community of Practice on RMMV to exchange experiences and lessons learned, and to share open source-based tools and open data sources. In addition to publishing RMMVrelated information and collaborating with others in expanding international standards relevant to RMMV, KfW will be organizing and participating in international events on RMMV.

If you are interested in joining this Community of Practice or to provide your feedback on the RMMV Guidebook, please contact KfW directly at > info@kfw-entwicklungsbank.de (please mention "RMMV4Dev" in the subject).
