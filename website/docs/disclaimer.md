### Remote Management, Monitoring, & Verification (RMMV) Guidebook for International Financial Cooperation
This _Guidebook_ was developed for all practitioners in preparing and implementing _Financial Cooperation_ (FC) projects and provides them with assistance and examples of how to manage, monitor, and verify FC projects remotely.

This _Guidebook_ was carefully drafted by KfW, its advisers, and experts on the topics covered, reflecting the extensive experience gained in KfW’s own FC projects. The material and information provided in this _Guidebook_ are, however, general in nature. It can only provide an initial general overview and some broad practitioner guidelines over relevant aspects, risks, and issues that typically occur in this context and that KfW deems to be generally of interest and importance when dealing with such types of projects and questions. It does not constitute any form of legal, technical, or other advice and therefore does not purport to replace such legal, technical, or other advice for a specific project or question by a user.

Before entering into any of the activities contemplated in this _Guidebook_, any _Guidebook_ user should first seek advice for themselves as they deem necessary and should not solely rely upon the material and information given herein as a basis for making any business, legal, or other decision. Any use of the material or information provided in this _Guidebook_ for specific projects is at the user’s own risk.

Due to the general nature of this _Guidebook_, conclusions drawn from it always need to be adjusted to the specific needs and design of the respective project context. KfW can therefore not be held liable for any use and any conclusions drawn from this _Guidebook_.

KfW makes no representation and excludes to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law any respon- sibility or liability for this _Guidebook_, its content, or any errors or omissions made in the content of this _Guidebook_. The information contained in this _Guidebook_ is provided for information purposes only and on an “as is” basis with no guarantees of completeness, accuracy, usefulness, or timeliness.
