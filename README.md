# What is RMMV ?

Remotely managed and administered projects are increasingly common practice for development cooperation in conflict zones, natural disasters, and even more so since the COVID-19 pandemic. RMMV is also useful for projects with many locations or projects covering large areas. 

The use of Remote Management, Monitoring, and Verification (RMMV) methods is becoming increasingly critical to Financial Cooperation in partner countries. RMMV is the approach to managing development projects from anywhere in the world in an evidence-based manner. What does the term RMMV mean exactly?

### Remote Management: 
- overall framework of developing and managing FC projects remotely
### Remote Monitoring: 
- monitoring of project activities, results and impacts by alternative actors (e.g. local rather than international project executing agency or consultant staff) and technical means (e.g. satellites, drones, sensors and smartphones, etc.). This is usually the responsibility of the project executing agencies or consultants.
### Remote Site Supervision: 
- construction supervision at project sites (usually performed by consultants)
### Remote Verification: 
- Verification of feasibilty studies, monitoring reports/ information, final inspection reports and ex-post evaluations by using institutional RMMV approaches, tools and / or data sources (= core task of KfW).
